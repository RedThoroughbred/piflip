## üì° Sub-GHz RF Tools (CC1101)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Signal Strength Meter** (Best Starting Point!)

**What it does:** Shows live signal strength in real-time

**When to use:**
- Before capturing - make sure you're in range
- Aiming your antenna for best reception
- Testing if your remote is transmitting

**How to use:**
1. Go to: **Sub-GHz Tools (CC1101) ‚Üí Signal Strength Meter**
2. See live RSSI bars: `‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì`
3. Press your remote button and watch bars increase
4. Move antenna until you get **60%+** signal strength
5. Close when done (swipe down on mobile)

**What the numbers mean:**
- **RSSI (dBm):** -115 to -50 dBm (lower = weaker)
  - `-74 dBm` = Good signal (your current ambient level)
  - `-90 dBm` = Weak but usable
  - `-50 dBm` = Excellent (very close)
- **Signal Strength:** 0-100% (easier to read)
  - `60%+` = Good for capture
  - `40-60%` = Marginal
  - `<40%` = Too weak

**Pro Tip:** Leave this running while positioning your antenna before capturing!

   - 433.07 MHz (alternate)
   - 433.42 MHz (alternate)
4. Shows which frequency has strongest signal
5. Use that frequency for capturing

**Expected output:**
```
433.92 MHz: -65 dBm ‚úÖ STRONG
315.00 MHz: -95 dBm (weak)
433.07 MHz: -90 dBm (weak)
```
