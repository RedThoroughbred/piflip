## üóëÔ∏è Why These Were Archived

**Old Sessions:** Development logs from initial build (Sep 28 - Oct 1, 2025). Project is now stable and documented.

**Historical Docs:** Troubleshooting docs for issues that have been resolved (power supply, hardware setup, etc.). Kept for reference.

**Deprecated Code:** `app.py` was a CLI-based interface. The project now uses `web_interface.py` which provides a full Flask web application with REST API.

## üì¶ Archive Policy

Files are archived rather than deleted to:
1. Preserve development history
2. Reference past solutions if similar issues arise
3. Track project evolution
4. Maintain complete documentation trail

**These files are NOT needed for running PiFlip** but may be useful for understanding the development process.
