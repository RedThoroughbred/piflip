# üîã How to Test Pi Power with Multimeter

## ‚ö° **DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMED: iPhone Brick is Too Weak!**

**iPhone bricks:**
- Old iPhone: **1A** (5W) ‚ùå Way too weak!
- iPhone 6-11: **1A** (5W) ‚ùå Way too weak!
- iPad brick: **2.1A** (10W) ‚ö†Ô∏è Borderline (not enough for RTL-SDR)
- iPhone 12+: **2.4A** (12W) ‚ö†Ô∏è Still not enough

**What Pi 3B + RTL-SDR needs:**
- **3A minimum** (15W)

**Your problem:** iPhone brick can't provide enough current!

## üîß **How to Test Power with Multimeter**

### **Method 1: Test Pi Voltage (Easy - 2 minutes)**

**What you're measuring:** Voltage at the Pi's power pins

**Steps:**

1. **Set multimeter to DC Voltage mode**
   - Turn dial to "V‚éì" or "DCV" or "20V DC"
   - Should read up to 20V DC

2. **Keep Pi powered on and running**

3. **Probe the GPIO pins:**
   ```
   Pi GPIO Header (top view):

   Pin 2 or 4 ‚Üí +5V (RED probe here)
   Pin 6 ‚Üí GND (BLACK probe here)

   Layout:
   [3.3V] [5V]  ‚Üê Pin 1, 2
   [GPIO] [5V]  ‚Üê Pin 3, 4
   [GPIO] [GND] ‚Üê Pin 5, 6
   ```

4. **Touch probes to pins:**
   - **RED (positive)** to Pin 2 or Pin 4 (5V pins)
   - **BLACK (ground)** to Pin 6 (GND)

5. **Read voltage on multimeter**

**What you should see:**
- **Good:** 5.0V - 5.2V ‚úÖ
- **Borderline:** 4.8V - 5.0V ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **BAD (your likely result):** 4.5V - 4.8V ‚ùå
- **Very Bad:** Under 4.5V ‚ùå‚ùå

**If under 4.8V:** Power supply is too weak!

---

### **Method 2: Check Test Points (More Accurate)**

**If your Pi has TP1 and TP2 test points:**

1. **Find TP1 and TP2:**
   - Small circular pads on Pi board
   - Usually near GPIO header or USB ports
   - TP1 = +5V
   - TP2 = GND

2. **Probe them:**
   - RED to TP1
   - BLACK to TP2

3. **Read voltage**

**Same criteria as above**

---

### **Method 3: USB Voltage Tester (If You Have One)**

**USB voltage/current meter:**
- Plugs between power supply and Pi
- Shows live voltage and current
- Amazon: $10-15
- Shows exact problem!

---

## üìä **What Your Test Will Show:**

**Prediction based on symptoms:**

| Test | Expected Result | What It Means |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Voltage** | 4.5V - 4.7V | Way too low! |
| **Under-voltage** | 0x50005 | Pi is throttled |
| **USB devices** | Not working well | Not enough current |
| **RTL-SDR** | Weak/no reception | Starved for power |

---

## ‚ö° **iPhone Brick Comparison:**

| Power Supply | Output | Works for Pi? | Works for Pi+RTL-SDR? |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **iPhone 5W** | 1A | ‚ö†Ô∏è Barely | ‚ùå No |
| **iPad 10W** | 2.1A | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe | ‚ùå No |
| **iPhone 12W** | 2.4A | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe | ‚ùå No |
| **iPhone 20W** | 3A+ | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Official Pi** | 3A | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Your iPhone brick:** Almost certainly 1A or 2.1A = **NOT ENOUGH!**

---

## ‚úÖ **THE SOLUTION: Get Proper Power Supply**

### **Option 1: Official Raspberry Pi Power Supply** ($8)

**What to search on Amazon:**
- "Raspberry Pi 3 Power Supply"
- "5V 3A Raspberry Pi adapter"
- "Official Raspberry Pi PSU"

**Specs needed:**
- **5.1V** (not 5.0V)
- **3A** minimum
- **Micro USB** connector (for Pi 3B)
- 15.3W total

**Recommended brands:**
- Official Raspberry Pi Foundation
- CanaKit
- Vilros

**Cost:** $8-12

---

### **Option 2: CanaKit 3A Supply** ($10)

**Amazon:** "CanaKit Raspberry Pi Power Supply"
- 5V 3A
- Micro USB
- Built-in noise filter
- Perfect for Pi 3B

---

### **Option 3: Use a Better Phone Charger You Might Have**

**Modern fast chargers that WILL work:**
- iPhone 20W USB-C charger (2020+) + USB-C to Micro USB cable
- Samsung 25W charger + cable
- Any USB-C PD charger 15W+ with proper cable

**Check your existing chargers:**
- Look at the label
- Need: 5V, 3A or higher
- Or: 9V, 2A (some phone fast chargers)

---

## üß™ **Quick Test WITHOUT Multimeter:**

You can also test by watching the behavior:

```bash
# Monitor voltage status live
watch -n 1 vcgencmd get_throttled
```

**Press Ctrl+C to stop**

**While watching, try:**
1. Unplug all USB devices except RTL-SDR
2. Watch if `throttled` value changes

**If it stays 0x50005:** Power supply is definitely too weak!

---

## üì± **Check Your iPhone Brick Label:**

**Look at the brick and find the output specs:**

**Old iPhone bricks say:**
```
Output: 5V ‚éì 1A
```
= 5 Watts = **TOO WEAK!**

**iPad bricks say:**
```
Output: 5.1V ‚éì 2.1A
```
= 10 Watts = **STILL TOO WEAK for RTL-SDR!**

**Modern iPhone bricks (12+) say:**
```
Output: 5V ‚éì 3A or 9V ‚éì 2.2A
```
= 15-20 Watts = **WILL WORK!**

**Take a photo of your brick's label and tell me what it says!**

## üéØ **Multimeter Test Instructions (Detailed):**

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Setup multimeter:**
   ```
   - Turn dial to DC Volts (V‚éì or 20V DC)
   - Plug BLACK probe into COM port
   - Plug RED probe into VŒ©mA port
   ```

2. **Pi must be ON and running everything:**
   ```
   - Power connected
   - RTL-SDR plugged in
   - dump1090 running
   - All normal operations
   ```

3. **Locate GPIO pins:**
   ```
   Look at Pi board, find 40-pin header
   Count from top-left:

   Pin 1 (3.3V) - Top left
   Pin 2 (5V)   - Top right  ‚Üê RED probe here
   Pin 6 (GND)  - 3rd from top, left side  ‚Üê BLACK probe here
   ```

4. **Probe the pins:**
   ```
   - Touch RED probe to Pin 2 (5V) gently
   - Touch BLACK probe to Pin 6 (GND) gently
   - Hold steady for 5 seconds
   ```

5. **Read the display:**
   ```
   Should show: 4.XX or 5.XX volts
   ```

6. **Interpret result:**
   ```
   5.0V - 5.2V  = ‚úÖ Good power
   4.8V - 5.0V  = ‚ö†Ô∏è Borderline
   4.5V - 4.8V  = ‚ùå Too low (your likely result)
   < 4.5V       = ‚ùå‚ùå Way too low
   ```

---

## üîß **What Happens with Low Voltage:**

**At 4.7V or below:**
- Pi throttles CPU (slows down)
- USB ports provide less current
- RTL-SDR can't receive properly
- Random crashes/freezes possible
- SD card corruption risk

**At 4.5V or below:**
- Pi may reboot randomly
- USB devices stop working
- Severe performance issues

---

## üí∞ **Cost to Fix:**

**Option 1: Buy proper power supply**
- Cost: $8-12
- Time: 1-2 days shipping
- Fixes: Everything permanently ‚úÖ

**Option 2: Powered USB hub**
- Cost: $15
- Time: 1-2 days shipping
- Fixes: RTL-SDR (but Pi still under-voltage)

**Option 3: Both**
- Cost: $25
- Best solution for portable build

**My recommendation:** Just get $10 power supply. Simplest fix!

---

## üéØ **Do This Right Now:**

### **Test 1: Check Your Brick's Label**

Look at the brick, find where it says:
```
Output: 5V ‚éì ?A
```

**Tell me:** What number is the "?"

**If it says 1A or 2.1A:** That's your problem! ‚úÖ Confirmed!

---

### **Test 2: Multimeter Test (Optional)**

Follow steps above, tell me what voltage you measure.

**Expected:** 4.5V - 4.8V (proves supply is weak)

---
