# üîß PiFlip Hardware Strategy Guide

## üéØ Your Current Situation

### **What's Working:**
‚úÖ Mac + GQRX + RTL-SDR = Sees key fobs, sees flights
‚ùå Pi + rtl_433/dump1090 = Doesn't see same signals

### **The Question:**
Should RTL-SDR stay on Pi or move to Mac?

---

## üìä **RTL-SDR Placement Comparison**

### **Option 1: RTL-SDR on Pi** (RECOMMENDED)

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| ‚úÖ Integrated PiFlip device | ‚ùå Needs better antenna placement |
| ‚úÖ 24/7 operation possible | ‚ùå USB hub may limit power |
| ‚úÖ Auto-capture scripts | ‚ùå Requires troubleshooting setup |
| ‚úÖ Web interface from phone | ‚ùå Pi 3B is slower than Mac |
| ‚úÖ True portable when done | |
| ‚úÖ Dedicated RF device | |

**Best for:** Building real Flipper-style portable device

---

### **Option 2: RTL-SDR on Mac**

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| ‚úÖ Already works well | ‚ùå Mac is your main computer |
| ‚úÖ More processing power | ‚ùå Not portable |
| ‚úÖ Better GUI tools (GQRX) | ‚ùå Can't run 24/7 |
| ‚úÖ Easy to troubleshoot | ‚ùå Defeats PiFlip concept |
|  | ‚ùå Mac tied to RF operations |

**Best for:** Development, testing, learning

---

### **Option 3: Two RTL-SDR Dongles** (BEST!)

| Device | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| RTL-SDR #1 | **Pi** | Flight tracking (1090MHz) |
| RTL-SDR #2 | **Pi** | Everything else (433/315/868MHz) |

**Cost:** $35 for second dongle

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No more mode switching needed!
- ‚úÖ Can track flights AND scan 433MHz simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Dedicated antennas for each frequency
- ‚úÖ Both always available

**This solves your biggest pain point!**

---

## üîç **Why Mac Works But Pi Doesn't**

### **1. Antenna Placement** (Most Likely!)

**Your Mac:**
- Probably on desk near window
- RTL-SDR antenna vertical and elevated
- Clear line of sight

**Your Pi:**
- Where is it located?
- Antenna position?
- Obstructions?

**Test:** Move Pi + RTL-SDR to **exact same spot** as Mac and try again.

---

### **2. USB Power Issue**

**Kensington Hub:**
- May not be **powered** hub
- RTL-SDR needs 500mA
- PN532 needs power
- CC1101 needs power
- Total: **Over 1A**

**Pi 3B USB ports:**
- Total 1.2A shared across all ports
- With hub + 3 devices = borderline

**Solution:**
```
Get POWERED USB hub with external power supply
Examples:
- Anker 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub ($30)
- Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub ($15)
- AmazonBasics Powered Hub ($20)
```

---

### **3. Gain Settings**

**GQRX (on Mac):**
- You manually adjusted gain slider
- Probably set to 30-40dB
- Optimized for your location

**rtl_433 (on Pi):**
- Default gain = AUTO (not always optimal)
- May be too low for your setup

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add -g 40 to all rtl_433 commands
rtl_433 -f 433.92M -g 40 -F json

# For dump1090:
# Edit: /etc/default/dump1090-fa
# Change: RECEIVER_OPTIONS="--gain 40"
```

---

## üéØ **My Recommendation: Fix the Pi Setup**

### **Step 1: Improve Antenna Placement**

**Move Pi to better location:**
- Near window (if possible)
- Elevated (not on floor)
- Away from metal objects
- Keep antenna vertical

**Or get antenna extension:**
```
USB Extension Cable (10-15 feet)
- Allows RTL-SDR to be at window
- Pi can stay at desk
- Cost: $5-10
```

---

### **Step 2: Get Powered USB Hub**

**Your current Kensington hub:**
- Is it powered? (has AC adapter plug?)
- If not, this is likely your problem

**Recommended hubs:**
```
For Portable PiFlip:
- Sabrent 4-Port Powered Hub ($15)
- Small, compact, external power

For Desktop Use:
- Anker 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub ($30)
- More ports for future expansion
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Gain to Commands**

Let me update your web interface to use higher gain:

## ü¶ä **What Flipper Zero Does Differently**

### **Flipper Zero Specs:**

| Feature | Flipper Zero | Your PiFlip |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Sub-GHz RX** | CC1101 | ‚úÖ CC1101 |
| **Sub-GHz TX** | CC1101 | ‚úÖ CC1101 |
| **125kHz RFID** | Built-in coil | ‚ùå (could add) |
| **NFC** | PN532-like | ‚úÖ PN532 |
| **Infrared** | Built-in LED | ‚ùå (could add) |
| **iButton** | 1-Wire | ‚ùå (could add) |
| **GPIO** | 18 pins | ‚úÖ 40 pins |
| **Screen** | 128x64 LCD | ‚è≥ Coming |
| **Battery** | 2000mAh | ‚è≥ Coming |
| **Antenna** | PCB antenna | External (better!) |

**Key difference:** Flipper uses **CC1101 for receive AND transmit**
- No RTL-SDR (narrowband only)
- Can't do wideband captures
- Can't track flights (no 1090MHz)
- Can't do 2.4GHz/WiFi/BLE

**Your PiFlip advantage:**
- RTL-SDR = Wideband receiver (24-1700MHz)
- Can capture full IQ data
- Flight tracking possible
- More powerful Linux software

## ‚úàÔ∏è **Fixing Flight Tracking**

### **Why Mac sees flights but Pi doesn't:**

**1. dump1090 Configuration**

Check current gain setting:
```bash
cat /etc/default/dump1090-fa | grep gain
```

**Should be:**
```
RECEIVER_OPTIONS="--gain 42 --max-range 300"
```

**Edit:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/dump1090-fa

# Change to:
RECEIVER_OPTIONS="--gain 42 --max-range 300 --aggressive"

# Save and restart:
sudo systemctl restart dump1090-fa
```

**2. Antenna**

1090MHz needs **DIFFERENT antenna** than 433MHz!

**Your RTL-SDR came with:**
- Telescoping antenna (optimized for FM ~100MHz)
- NOT ideal for 1090MHz

**Better options:**
```
For ADS-B (flights):
- FlightAware ADS-B Antenna ($20)
- DIY 1090MHz dipole (free!)

For 433MHz (key fobs):
- Stock antenna works OK
- Or make 433MHz dipole
```

**DIY 1090MHz Antenna:**
```
Wire length: 69mm (1/4 wavelength)
Cost: $0 (coat hanger wire)
Performance: Better than stock!
```

**3. Location**

ADS-B needs **line of sight to sky:**
- Window placement best
- Higher is better
- Indoor: 5-40 mile range
- Outdoor elevated: 100-200 miles

## üîë **Capturing Your Key Fob (Pi)**

### **Test Right Now:**

**1. Check mode:**
```bash
# Should be "scanning mode"
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/rtlsdr/mode
```

**2. Run optimized capture:**
```bash
# I created this script for you:
~/piflip/capture_keyfob.sh

# Or manually:
timeout 20 rtl_433 -f 433.92M -g 40 -s 250000 -Y auto -F json
```

**3. Press key fob DURING scan:**
- Lock button
- Unlock button
- Press 3-4 times
- Hold each for 1 second

**4. If still nothing:**

**Check frequency:**
- Most US key fobs: 315MHz
- Most EU key fobs: 433.92MHz
- Some US: 433.92MHz

**Try 315MHz:**
```bash
timeout 20 rtl_433 -f 315M -g 40 -F json
```
