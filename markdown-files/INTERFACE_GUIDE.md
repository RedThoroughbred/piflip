- Can scan 433MHz ✅
- Can scan TPMS ✅
- Can scan weather ✅
- Can capture signals ✅

**How to use:**
1. Click "🔄 Switch Mode" button
2. Page auto-reloads
3. Mode indicator shows current mode

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional
**Why:** RTL-SDR can only do ONE thing at a time

## 🎛️ WHAT'S NOT CONNECTED YET

### NFC Features (Exist in CLI, not in web yet)
❌ **Store Card** - Save UID to memory
❌ **List Stored Cards** - View saved UIDs
❌ **Compare Card** - Check if known
❌ **Clone Card** - Write to magic card
❌ **List Backups** - View backed up UIDs
❌ **Restore from Backup** - Write backup to card
❌ **Read Data Blocks** - Read MIFARE sectors
❌ **Swap UIDs** - Swap two magic cards

**Where they work:** Run `python3 pi-flipper.py` for full NFC features

---

### Advanced RF Features (Coming Soon)
❌ **Protocol Library** - Pre-built transmitters
❌ **Brute Force** - Systematic code trying
❌ **Frequency Sweep** - Auto-scan bands
❌ **Spectrum Analyzer** - Visual waterfall
❌ **Signal Comparison** - Diff two captures
❌ **URH GUI Integration** - Browser-based analysis

---

### Advanced Replay (Partially Working)
⚠️ **Current Replay:** Transmits test burst on correct frequency
❌ **Full Replay:** Needs URH to decode bit pattern first
❌ **Protocol-Aware:** Smart replay with rolling code detection

**How to improve:**
1. Capture signal ✅
2. Open URH GUI: `urh ~/piflip/captures/yourfile.cu8`
3. Analyze & extract bit pattern (manual for now)
4. Export protocol
5. Replay will be more accurate

## 💡 TIPS & TRICKS

### Getting Better Results:

**433MHz Scanning:**
- Press device DURING scan (not before)
- Hold button for 2-3 seconds
- Try multiple times if it misses
- Some devices need fresh batteries

**Signal Capture:**
- 5 seconds is usually enough
- Press device RIGHT when capture starts
- Press multiple times during capture
- Name captures clearly (e.g., "red_garage_door")

**NFC:**
- Card must touch reader (within 1cm)
- Hold steady for 1-2 seconds
- Some cards need to be centered
- Works best with MIFARE Classic

**Flight Tracking:**
- Needs aircraft overhead (check globe.adsbexchange.com)
- Indoor antenna: 5-40 mile range
- Outdoor elevated antenna: 40-200 miles
- More flights during daytime

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No data found"
**Cause:** Device not transmitting or out of range
**Fix:** Press device during scan, move closer

### "RTL-SDR is in use"
**Cause:** In wrong mode
**Fix:** Click "Switch Mode" button at top

### "CC1101 not initialized"
**Cause:** Web interface started without CC1101
**Fix:** Restart web interface: `./start_piflip.sh`

### "No card found"
**Cause:** Card not on reader or too far
**Fix:** Place card directly on PN532 module

### "Map shows no planes"
**Cause:** No aircraft in range OR antenna issue
**Fix:**
1. Check https://globe.adsbexchange.com/
2. Move antenna to window
3. Wait for planes to fly over
