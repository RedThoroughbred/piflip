## 🎓 **User Education**

### **FAQ Section:**

**Q: Will Guardian drain my battery?**
A: Guardian uses minimal power. Run it only when needed (crowded places).

**Q: Can I use this on my phone's NFC?**
A: No, PiFlip uses PN532 hardware. Phone NFC can't monitor passively.

**Q: Will this block NFC?**
A: No, PiFlip only monitors. Use RFID-blocking wallet for protection.

**Q: How many cards can I register?**
A: Unlimited! Catalog has no size limit.

**Q: Does wallet test damage cards?**
A: No, it only reads. Safe for all cards.

**Q: What's a "suspicious event"?**
A: 3+ scans in 5 seconds, or multiple different cards quickly.

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Guardian not detecting scans**
**Solution:**
1. Check PN532 connected: `http://piflip.local:5000`
2. Green checkmark next to PN532?
3. Try NFC Tools → Scan Card to verify
4. If scan works, Guardian should too

### **Problem: "No card detected" when adding to catalog**
**Solution:**
1. Hold card flat against PN532
2. Try different position/angle
3. Card should be 1-2cm from reader
4. Some cards (thick) need closer contact

### **Problem: Wallet test shows card always readable**
**Solution:**
1. Card may be too far from reader
2. Try wallet touching PiFlip
3. Some thick wallets need pressure
4. Or... your wallet doesn't actually block RFID!
