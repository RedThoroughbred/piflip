# Flight Tracking Feature Removed

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Reason:** dump1090-fa not working properly, added unnecessary complexity

---

## 🎯 What Was Removed

### Software:
- ✅ dump1090-fa (uninstalled)
- ✅ piaware (uninstalled)
- ✅ lighttpd web server (uninstalled)
- ✅ 181 dependency packages (autoremoved)

### Code:
- ✅ `/api/flights` endpoint
- ✅ `/api/flights/stats` endpoint
- ✅ `/api/rtlsdr/mode` endpoint
- ✅ `/api/rtlsdr/toggle` endpoint
- ✅ Mode toggle UI component
- ✅ Flight tracking menu section

### Disk Space Freed:
- **97 MB** total freed

---

## ✨ Benefits

### Simplified Experience:
1. **No More Mode Switching** - RTL-SDR always available for scanning
2. **No More Conflicts** - No "device busy" errors
3. **Faster Installation** - Fewer dependencies
4. **Cleaner Interface** - One purpose: RF scanning
5. **Less Confusion** - No need to understand modes

### What Still Works:
- ✅ 433MHz device scanning
- ✅ RF signal capture (IQ data)
- ✅ Signal replay via CC1101
- ✅ TPMS sensor detection
- ✅ Weather station detection
- ✅ NFC card operations
- ✅ All core PiFlip features

### What Doesn't Work Anymore:
- ❌ Flight tracking (ADS-B 1090MHz)
- ❌ Aircraft map display
- ❌ Flight statistics

---

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### If You Were Using Flight Tracking:

**Option 1: Reinstall dump1090 separately**
```bash
# Install as standalone service
wget -O - https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/files/flightaware.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/repository bookworm piaware" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/piaware.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dump1090-fa

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl enable dump1090-fa
sudo systemctl start dump1090-fa

# Access at http://YOUR_PI_IP:8080
```

**Option 2: Use a dedicated flight tracking solution**
- **FlightAware PiAware** - Full installation
- **dump1090-mutability** - Alternative
- **readsb** - Modern dump1090 fork

**Note:** If you reinstall dump1090, you'll need to manually stop it before using PiFlip for RF scanning.

## 📝 Documentation Updates Needed

The following documentation files still reference flight tracking and need updates:

### High Priority:
- [ ] `README.md` - Remove flight tracking features section
- [ ] `claude.md` - Update capabilities list
- [ ] `markdown-files/QUICK_START.md` - Remove flight tracking steps
- [ ] `markdown-files/INTERFACE_GUIDE.md` - Remove flight menu documentation

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] `markdown-files/PROCESS_MANAGEMENT.md` - Remove mode switching sections
- [ ] `markdown-files/INSTALL.md` - Remove dump1090 installation steps
- [ ] `markdown-files/ROADMAP.md` - Update future plans

### Low Priority (Archive):
- [ ] `markdown-files/FLIGHT_TRACKING_GUIDE.md` - Move to archive or delete
- [ ] `markdown-files/RTL-SDR-CONFLICT.md` - Update or remove

## 🎯 PiFlip Focus

PiFlip is now **focused on sub-GHz RF operations:**

### Primary Use Cases:
1. **Capture and analyze RF signals** (315-434MHz)
2. **Clone and replay signals** (key fobs, remotes, etc.)
3. **Monitor TPMS** (tire pressure sensors)
4. **Detect weather stations**
5. **Read/write NFC cards**
6. **Transmit with CC1101**

### Hardware Fully Supported:
- ✅ RTL-SDR (no conflicts!)
- ✅ CC1101 (433MHz TX/RX)
- ✅ PN532 (NFC/RFID)

---

## 💡 Rationale

### Why Remove Flight Tracking?

1. **Not Working Properly**
   - dump1090-fa had issues on this Pi
   - Not the core purpose of PiFlip

2. **Added Complexity**
   - Mode switching confusion
   - RTL-SDR conflicts
   - Extra dependencies

3. **Better Alternatives Exist**
   - Dedicated flight tracking setups work better
   - FlightAware PiAware is purpose-built
   - Can run separately if needed

4. **PiFlip Identity**
   - Focus on RF hacking tools
   - Sub-GHz operations (like Flipper Zero)
   - Not a flight tracker

---

## ✅ System Status

### After Removal:

**Services Running:**
- ✅ piflip.service (web interface)
- ✅ ssh, dhcpcd, etc. (system services)

**Services Removed:**
- ❌ dump1090-fa
- ❌ lighttpd

**RTL-SDR Status:**
- ✅ Always available for scanning
- ✅ No conflicts
- ✅ No mode switching needed

**Web Interface:**
- ✅ Running on port 5000
- ✅ All RF scanning features work
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler UI

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Update Documentation** - Remove flight tracking references
2. **Test All Features** - Verify RF scanning works perfectly
3. **Push to GitHub** - Share simplified version
4. **Update README** - Reflect new focus

---

**PiFlip is now a dedicated RF scanning and NFC tool - simpler, faster, and more focused!** 🦊✨
