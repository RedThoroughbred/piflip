# Advanced TX Testing Guide üöÄ

**Safe & Legal Testing of PiFlip Advanced TX Features**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY RULES

### ‚úÖ LEGAL & SAFE:
- **Your own devices** (garage door opener, car key fob, remote control)
- **Devices you own** in isolated environment
- **Educational testing** with consent
- **Your own property**

### ‚ùå ILLEGAL & DANGEROUS:
- Other people's devices
- Public infrastructure (traffic lights, emergency systems)
- Communication systems (police, fire, aviation)
- Neighbors' devices without permission

---

## üß™ SAFE TESTING SCENARIOS

### **1. Garage Door Opener (Best for Testing!)**

**Replay with Variations:**
```
1. Capture your garage remote signal first:
   RF Tools ‚Üí Capture Signal ‚Üí 433.92 MHz
   Name it: "garage_remote"

2. Test replay with variations:
   Advanced TX ‚Üí Replay with Variations
   Signal name: garage_remote

   This tries the signal at:
   - 433.42, 433.67, 433.92, 434.17, 434.42 MHz
   - With timing variations: 95%, 100%, 105%
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own garage
- No harm if it works or doesn't
- Easy to test (visual feedback)
- Common 433.92 MHz frequency

---

### **2. Car Key Fob (Rolling Code Test)**

**Rolling Code Helper:**
```
1. Stand near your car (make sure it's yours!)

2. Advanced TX ‚Üí Rolling Code Helper
   Frequency: 433.92 (or 315 MHz for some cars)

3. Press your car remote when prompted

4. Tool captures and immediately replays 5 times

Note: Modern cars use rolling codes, so this
usually won't unlock the car, but it demonstrates
the capture/replay process safely.
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own vehicle
- Rolling codes make it secure
- Educational demonstration
- No actual security bypass

---

### **3. Wireless Doorbell (Brute Force Test)**

**If you have a simple wireless doorbell:**
```
1. Note the doorbell frequency (usually 433.92 MHz)

2. Advanced TX ‚Üí Brute Force Codes
   Frequency: 433.92
   Bit length: 8 (256 codes, ~25 seconds)

3. Listen for doorbell to ring

This demonstrates how simple fixed-code devices
can be vulnerable.
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own doorbell
- Simple device, no security risk
- Quick test (8-bit = 256 codes)
- Educational value

---

### **4. TV/AC Remote Control (Custom Signal)**

**Create custom IR/RF signals:**
```
1. If remote uses 433 MHz (some do):

2. Advanced TX ‚Üí Custom Signal
   Frequency: 433.92
   Pattern: 1111000011110000 (example)
   Bit duration: 500

3. See if TV/AC responds

This teaches signal encoding!
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own electronics
- No harm, just entertainment control
- Easy to verify
- Learn signal structure

---

### **5. Weather Station Sensors (Signal Fuzzing)**

**If you have weather sensors:**
```
1. Capture weather sensor signal:
   RF Tools ‚Üí Capture Signal ‚Üí 433.92 MHz
   Name it: "weather_sensor"

2. Advanced TX ‚Üí Signal Fuzzing
   Signal: weather_sensor
   Fuzz: 10%
   Iterations: 50

3. See if base station receives data

This helps understand timing tolerances.
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own weather station
- No security implications
- Learn protocol robustness
- Educational

---

### **6. Frequency Jammer (Controlled Test)**

**ONLY test in isolated environment:**
```
1. Take PiFlip to basement/garage
   (away from neighbors)

2. Set up a walkie-talkie on 433 MHz

3. Advanced TX ‚Üí Frequency Jammer
   Frequency: 433.92
   Duration: 5 seconds
   Pattern: noise

4. See if walkie-talkie communication is disrupted

This demonstrates jamming SAFELY.
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Your own space
- Your own devices
- Short duration (5-10 seconds max)
- Educational demonstration

---

- [ ] No neighbors will be affected
- [ ] I understand what the feature does
- [ ] I have permission (if not solely mine)
- [ ] Device is not safety-critical
- [ ] Test environment is isolated

```
Goal: Understand timing tolerances

1. Capture simple remote (doorbell, etc)
2. Use Signal Fuzzing with 5%, 10%, 20% variation
3. Note: Which fuzz % still works?

Learning: How precise must timing be?
```

### **Experiment 3: Frequency Accuracy**
```
Goal: Learn frequency tolerances

1. Capture any 433 MHz remote
2. Use Replay with Variations
3. Note: Does ¬±0.5 MHz still work?

Learning: Receiver bandwidth understanding
```

### **Experiment 4: Code Space Analysis**
```
Goal: Understand code complexity

1. Simple doorbell: 8-bit brute force (256 codes, works!)
2. Note: How many codes until success?
3. Try 12-bit (4,096 codes - takes longer)

Learning: Why longer codes are more secure
```

## üõ°Ô∏è RESPONSIBLE USE GUIDELINES

### **Research Ethics:**
1. **Document your findings** - Learn from each test
2. **Share knowledge responsibly** - Help others learn safely
3. **Report vulnerabilities** - If you find security issues in your devices, contact manufacturers
4. **Never exploit** - Research ‚â† Malicious use

### **Legal Considerations:**
- **FCC Regulations** - PiFlip operates in ISM bands (433 MHz legal in US)
- **Power Limits** - CC1101 ~10mW is legal for unlicensed use
- **Interference** - Don't cause harmful interference
- **Intent Matters** - Educational testing vs. malicious use

### **When in Doubt:**
- ‚ùì "Can I test this?" ‚Üí If you have to ask, probably not
- ‚ùì "Is this legal?" ‚Üí Only on devices you own
- ‚ùì "Will this harm anyone?" ‚Üí If yes, DON'T DO IT
