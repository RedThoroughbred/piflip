# October 10, 2025 - NFC Security Suite Update

## üéâ What's New

Today we implemented a complete **NFC Security Suite** with three major features that transform PiFlip into a powerful NFC security tool.

- Scan history tracking (last 1000 scans)
- Suspicious event logging with timestamps
- Daily statistics (scans today, threats detected today)
- Alert level system (normal/elevated)
- Automatic threat classification

**Use Cases:**
- Detect NFC skimmers in crowded areas (malls, airports, subway)
- Monitor for unauthorized card access attempts
- Security research and testing
- Personal NFC activity awareness

**API Endpoints:** 5 new
- `GET /api/guardian/status`
- `POST /api/guardian/start`
- `POST /api/guardian/stop`
- `GET /api/guardian/suspicious`
- `POST /api/guardian/clear_history`

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Deep Analysis Error Fixed
**Issue:** NFC Deep Analysis failed with "block.substring is not a function"

**Root Cause:** NFC card data returns blocks as byte arrays `[0x12, 0x34, ...]`, but JavaScript was calling `.substring()` method which only exists on strings.

**Fix:** Added type checking and conversion:
```javascript
const blockStr = Array.isArray(block)
    ? block.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('')
    : String(block);
output += `Block ${idx}: ${blockStr.substring(0, 32)}...`;
```

**Location:** `templates/flipper_ui.html:2122`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and tested
